// This manages the cluster's communication channels.
//
// The cluster works by creating a full mesh of connections. Thus, exactly
// like Erlang, this design tends to break down at a certain size.
//
// The protocol is this:
//
// * Each of the nodes pairs forms a "Connection".
// * The node in a Connection with the LOWER NodeID is responsible for
//   establishing the connection to the other node, which it will try
//   to maintain.
// * The connecting node performs an SSL handshake. Both sides provide
//   their certificates to the other, and both sides verify that the
//   certificate has been signed.
//
//   The nodes then validate over SSL that they have the same cluster definition.
//
// * Having established the connection, the Clustering handshake is then
//   exchanged. This contains version information for the clustering protocol,
//   and the hash of each side's clustering information, and the node IDs
//   each side thinks they are talking to. If the nodes don't match, it's a
//   FATAL error for the connection. If the HASH of the cluster info doesn't
//   match, it's a non-fatal error that issues a warning.
//
//   At this point, one of two things happen:
//   1. The nodes are both in the same "Group", in which case they
//      drop the SSL and return to using the socket directly.
//   2. The nodes are in different Groups, and retain their SSL connection.
//      Additionally, "large" messages will be gzip'ed.
//
// * Finally, we begin the clustering itself, which consists of sending messages
//   across.
//
// Since we use gob encoding, we inherit two major aspects of the gob system:
//
// * Most versioning is dealt with in the gob manner of just sort of flinging
//   struct members in the relevant places and hoping for the best. While
//   this makes me personally a bit uncomfortable, it seems to be the Go way,
//   and I'm not going to fight it.
// * All types of messages that are going to be sent need to be Registered
//   with the gob encoder, which is somewhat inconvenient. Reign will take
//   care of automatically registering all of its messages, but you'll need
//   to provide a registration of all types of messages you send to a mailbox.
//   (Since mailboxes use interface{}, this means ALL messages you might
//   send.)
